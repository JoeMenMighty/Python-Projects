'''
You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. 
The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Split string method

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#First *fork* your copy. Then copy-paste your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#Finally click "Run" to execute the tests

#get the number of people availlable

#select person based on the number generated
